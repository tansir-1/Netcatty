# Netcatty Tool CLI

Use this skill for external ACP agents when Netcatty is configured for `Skills + CLI` mode.

For routine tasks, the host prompt is usually enough. Read only the reference that matches the task type.

## Router

1. Use the exact Netcatty CLI prefix provided by the host prompt.
2. The current chat session is already bound in `NETCATTY_CLI_CHAT_SESSION_ID`. There is no chat-session CLI flag.
3. Treat `--session <session-id>` as required for `session`, `exec`, and every `sftp` operation.
4. Classify the task before choosing a command path:
   - Remote command execution tasks go through the exec reference.
   - Remote file or directory tasks go through the sftp reference.
   - If the user explicitly says to avoid shell or `exec`, do not use `exec`.
   - Treat `exec` as the short-command path only. If the command may exceed about 60 seconds, or streams output for an extended period, use the long-running job commands instead of plain `exec`.
5. If the host prompt already names a connected default target session, use that session directly for routine requests that do not mention another session or host, but still start with `session --session <id> --json` instead of jumping straight to `exec` or `sftp`.
6. Only fall back to `env` lookup when the task is ambiguous, the user points to another session, or that direct `session` lookup fails.

## Core Rules

- Treat the host-provided CLI prefix as the only supported entrypoint for this session.
- If a command launcher is needed, prefer the operating system's built-in launcher for the current environment; do not require optional shells that may not be installed.
- Run Netcatty CLI commands strictly serially.
- Treat Netcatty CLI errors as authoritative.
- Never ask the user for SSH credentials, key paths, proxy settings, or jump-host details when Netcatty session access already exists.
- Do not pause to explain the plan, re-read this skill, or design scripts before trying that shortest path.
- When presenting structured results, prefer a concise table if it fits clearly.

Examples:

- On Windows, if a literal shell command line is required, use the host-provided prefix with the system launcher available in the environment, such as `cmd.exe` or Windows PowerShell; do not assume PowerShell 7 `pwsh.exe` exists.
- On macOS or Linux, use the host-provided prefix directly, or the system shell already available in that environment when a shell command line is unavoidable.
- When the execution surface accepts argv-style calls, use the Netcatty launcher path as the executable and pass subcommands and flags as separate arguments instead of wrapping it in another shell.
