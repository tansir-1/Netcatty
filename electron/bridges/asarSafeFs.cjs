/**
 * asarSafeFs - Local filesystem reads that bypass Electron's asar interception.
 *
 * Electron patches node:fs so that ANY local path whose segment ends with
 * .asar (case-insensitive) is treated as an asar archive instead of reaching
 * the real filesystem (electron/lib/node/asar-fs-wrapper.ts, asarRe = /\.asar/i).
 * Uploading a real file named app.asar then fails before any network I/O with
 * the archive-root error `ENOENT,  not found in <path>` (the two spaces come
 * from the empty inner filePath), while the identical bytes named app.bin
 * upload fine (#3450).
 *
 * The official switch is process.noAsar = true, but it must only be flipped
 * around the exact fs call that resolves the path, because:
 * - stat / open resolve asar-ness synchronously at call time, and fd-level
 *   operations (fs.read, handle.stat, fs.fstat) on the returned real fd are
 *   not intercepted again;
 * - fs.createReadStream resolves asar-ness lazily when the stream opens the
 *   fd, so a synchronous toggle around the call is not enough — open the fd
 *   with a scoped toggle and hand the stream `{ fd }` instead;
 * - ssh2 fastPut resolves asar-ness through the synchronous `fs.open` inside
 *   fastXfer, so a scoped toggle around the fastPut call covers it.
 * The toggle is always restored synchronously, so concurrent require() from
 * app.asar and other asar-aware fs users are unaffected.
