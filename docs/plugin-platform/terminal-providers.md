# Terminal Provider API

PR 5 adds the host-owned terminal Provider registry on top of the isolated
runtime and permission boundary. Provider declarations remain immutable
manifest data. Listing Providers never starts a plugin; first invocation uses
the existing idempotent `onProvider:<id>` activation seam and revalidates the
active plugin version and runtime identity after the response.

## Runtime registration

An activated plugin registers only contributions owned by its exact plugin ID:

```ts
context.subscriptions.add(context.providers.register(
  "com.example.shell.completion",
  "terminal.completion",
  async ({ payload, cancellationToken }) => {
    if (cancellationToken.isCancellationRequested) return { items: [] };
    return { items: [{ text: "git status", displayText: "git status", score: 100 }] };
  },
));
```

Registration is activation-owned and disposable. A stale disposable cannot
remove a replacement registration. Invocation carries the declared Provider
ID/kind, an operation, a host-generated request ID, a bounded JSON payload, the
deadline, and a cooperative cancellation token. Results use the canonical
`ok`/`cancelled`/`failed` Provider result union and are validated again by the
main process before renderer use.

Each invocation reauthorizes the Provider kind's least-privilege permission
set against the current runtime identity before sending a session snapshot or
request payload. Required grants are reused; optional declarations prompt at
first use and denial/cancellation returns no terminal data to the runtime.

## Terminal snapshots and lifecycle

Providers receive immutable metadata snapshots containing only stable session
identity and presentation context: session/host/workspace IDs, protocol,
connection status, cwd, title, shell type, dimensions, and alternate-screen
state. Active runtimes can subscribe with `context.terminals.onDidChange()`.
Protocol values preserve the actual built-in transport (`ssh`, `mosh`, `et`,
`telnet`, `local`, or `serial`) and accept bounded namespaced identifiers for
future connection Providers instead of collapsing non-SSH transports to SSH.
Immediately before an invocation, a lazily activated Provider receives a
`snapshot` event for the current session so it does not depend on lifecycle
events that occurred before activation.
Lifecycle events cover creation, connection/reconnection, cwd/title/resize/
alternate-screen changes, command submission, host-detected command completion,
disconnect, and disposal. Completion events contain no command text or raw
output and are emitted from OSC 133 completion markers when available, with a
conservative next-prompt fallback for shells without integration markers.
Connection-scoped cwd, title, and alternate-screen metadata is cleared before
disconnect and reconnect publication; viewport dimensions remain available.
Ongoing lifecycle delivery begins only after a successful invocation with a
non-`once` `provider.terminal` grant. Each event rechecks that grant without
opening a new prompt and remains bound to the exact plugin version, runtime ID,
runtime kind, and security principal that received the authorized invocation.
One-use grants receive only the invocation snapshot and payload.

PR 5 intentionally omits command text, password/prompt content, raw terminal
output, xterm objects, backend handles, and terminal-worker ports. The ordinary
JSON-RPC Provider path is not suitable for hot interception. PR 6 owns the
separate permission-gated MessagePort fast path for input/output interceptors,
sensitive-input bypass, circuit breaking, and the 4 ms interceptor budget.

## Host adapters

Netcatty's built-in autocomplete engine and keyword highlighter use the same
application Provider adapters as plugins:

- completion requests run built-in and plugin Providers concurrently;
- one active request exists per session and Provider kind; a newer request
  cancels and suppresses the older result;
- Provider ordering is deterministic and can honor a host-owned preference
  list; completion items are score-ranked and text-deduplicated;
- one Provider failure is contained and does not suppress other Providers;
- plugin completion responses are capped and normalized before rendering;
- completion insertion/display text rejects control and bidirectional override
  characters before it can reach terminal input or suggestion UI. The host
  always renders the exact insertion text for third-party completions, so a
  friendly label cannot conceal a different command on previewless terminals;
- decoration Providers return declarative rules only. Rule IDs are namespaced,
  counts and strings are bounded, colors must be explicit hex values, and
  unsupported expressions are rejected before reaching the highlighter, and
  accepted plugin patterns are compiled and executed by the linear-time RE2JS
  engine with global, case-insensitive matching;
- decoration results are capped again after Provider fan-out at 16 active
  rules and 32 total patterns. Plugin matching examines at most the first 4096
  characters and retains at most 256 plugin matches for one logical line. A
  wrapped logical line is matched only once per refresh before ranges are
  projected onto its physical rows; plugin decoration is omitted for oversized
  wrapped blocks that cannot be assembled safely. Patterns that can match an
  empty string are rejected because they cannot produce a visible highlight.
  Normal boot and hibernate wake share the same CWD-triggered decoration refresh
  path;
- link and hover Providers receive one bounded physical xterm line and return
  exact zero-based ranges. Links are restricted to credential-free HTTP(S)
  URLs, reuse the host link-modifier policy, and render hover text with host
  DOM nodes rather than plugin HTML. UTF-16 result boundaries are mapped back
  to xterm cells so wide and combining characters cannot shift activation or
  decoration ranges. Requests pause while the terminal is hidden or
  disconnected, and in-flight results are aborted and invalidated on either
  transition;
- matcher Providers receive at most the latest 32 parsed logical normal-buffer
  lines in one batch. Wrapped physical rows are joined before invocation and
  exact logical ranges are split back across host-owned xterm decorations.
  Each result identifies a host-provided `lineId`; ranges are validated against
  that exact line, the combined request text is capped below the 128 KiB
  Provider envelope, and at most 64 logical matches remain visible.
  Alternate-screen output is excluded;
- semantic Providers receive only a bounded command submitted from a
  positively confirmed shell prompt (or an explicitly identified network
  device prompt) and require `terminal.input`. Authentication challenges,
  REPL input, and other untrusted prompt-shaped input never reach ordinary
  Providers. Prompt Providers receive no command or raw output. Their
  bounded annotations are rendered at host-detected command completion. A
  prompt line is included only when the shared host detector confirms an empty
  shell prompt, so the last output line is never mislabeled as prompt context;
- background Providers return at most four solid-color presentation layers.
  Per-layer opacity and the combined host overlay are capped at 0.35, plugin
  HTML/CSS/images are never accepted, and the request includes the current
  terminal background color for contrast-aware results. An omitted layer
  opacity uses the host-owned safe default of 0.15. Providers may request
  a 250-60000 ms host refresh cadence; refresh pauses while the terminal is
  hidden or disconnected and is disabled when reduced motion is requested;
- theme Providers receive the complete current host palette and may return a
  bounded partial palette of explicit colors. Providers are merged in the same
  deterministic preference order as enumeration, with the first value for each
  color winning; host colors remain authoritative for omitted values;
- every ordinary visual adapter applies a renderer-owned end-to-end wait bound
  around lazy activation, authorization, and runtime work. Stale generations,
  disconnects, contribution changes, runtime replacement, and terminal
  disposal cannot reapply old visual results. Provider availability is cached
  from immutable enumeration without activation, stale enumeration generations
  cannot overwrite newer contribution state, and enumeration errors fail
  closed. Autocomplete, decoration, link, hover, matcher, and background paths
  therefore perform no plugin RPC work when those contribution kinds are
  absent or the development-gated host is disabled.

The operation payload/result shapes for the ordinary adapters are intentionally
declarative. Every payload also contains the immutable `session` snapshot for
the exact invocation:

- `terminal.completion/provideCompletions`: bounded input, cursor, host OS,
  CWD source, and result limit -> bounded completion items;
- `terminal.decoration/provideDecorations`: a host refresh reason -> bounded
  declarative highlight rules;
- `terminal.link/provideLinks`: `{ line, bufferLineNumber }` ->
  `{ links: [{ start, length, uri, label? }] }`;
- `terminal.hover/provideHovers`: `{ line, bufferLineNumber }` ->
  `{ hovers: [{ start, length, contents }] }`;
- `terminal.matcher/provideMatches`: `{ lines: [{ lineId, line,
  bufferLineNumber }] }` -> `{ matches: [{ lineId, start, length, label,
  severity?, color? }] }`;
- `terminal.semantic/provideSemantics`: `{ command }` -> classification,
  destructive/idempotent flags, and bounded annotations;
- `terminal.prompt/provideAnnotations`: a host reason -> bounded annotations;
- `terminal.background/provideBackgrounds`: a host reason and optional current
  terminal background -> bounded solid-color layers plus optional
  `refreshAfterMs`.
- `terminal.theme/provideTheme`: a host reason and complete current host palette
  -> a validated partial terminal palette.

The SDK exports and infers the matching payload, item, operation, and result
interfaces for all nine ordinary Provider kinds, including the immutable
host session snapshot attached to every invocation. The generic registration
overload remains available for later Provider kinds, so plugins do not need
application-internal renderer types and PRs 6-9 can add their own typed maps.

The control-plane JSON budget remains 1 MiB, while each terminal Provider
payload and result is additionally limited to 128 KiB. Default terminal
Provider requests have a 1.5 second deadline; autocomplete uses a shorter 750
ms runtime deadline plus an 800 ms renderer-owned end-to-end wait bound that
also covers lazy activation and first-use authorization. Built-in suggestions
therefore remain available when a plugin prompt is unanswered. Renderer
request cancellation is owned by the requesting
WebContents and all outstanding work is aborted when that sender is destroyed.
A single renderer may retain at most 64 active terminal requests, and one
fan-out invokes at most the first 32 deterministically ranked Providers.

## Downstream compatibility

The registry uses the existing generic Provider request/result envelopes,
runtime identity, cancellation, progress, permission names, and stream
protocol. PR 6 can add its direct interceptor transport without changing the
ordinary registry. PR 7 connection/auth/import, PR 8 sync, and PR 9 rollout can
reuse the same registration and runtime lifecycle while defining their own
operation-specific result validators and bounded stream consumers.
